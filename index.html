            <p class="paragraph">As I type out the title of the page "My Favorite Thing", I am reminded of my childhood, watching The Sound of Music, and singing along to a song. A simple song about simple things that bring Maria Von Trapp joy. It has a sweet melody, and in the video, we watch as an otherwise mundane night turns into chaos, but through the power of improve and the desire to wrap her newly designated wards in an atmosphere of comfort and normality, Maria beings to sing. She sings of comforts that like a chair in a room can blend into the landscape of our everyday, raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. Soon, there is dancing, giggling, and the Von Trapp children are rid of any fear or dread. But, for Maria, who was struggling with acceptance in her new position, she, by giving to the children found joy herself.</p> 
            
            <p class="paragraph2"> Having grown and leaving behind the simplicity of childhood, we become hardened, skeptical, and out of obligation live for ourselves. To re-kindle joy, we find things that bring us happiness. Happiness though, is fleeting, and joy at times seems like hope. Lost. What I have discovered through the path of turbulent times is giving. Giving, I find, will leave you overflowing with peace, true joy, hope, and love. As a bonus, giving when your strength is stretched so far, it's transparent, is like drinking out of a firehose of joy. I encourage you to try it. Below are some ways I refill myself in giving back, I hope you find them inspiring.</p>

            <p> <b>Sharing helpful info - </b>I enjoy being a well of information for those in need. Oftentimes I find that the best way to help people is to share the location of possible solutions to their problems, or at the least a good starting point. 
                I try to be a bridge builder professionally as being in hospital operations I work with a lot of talented and connected professionals, who when working together can do a lot of good for people in need. Heads of finance, for those in financial crises. Case managers are a walking directory of resources in their communities, along with my fellow leaders for when I hear of someone needing a job.

                <br>
                <b>Helping people find resources - </b>
                I love doing research when I know someone who is stuck and needs help but doesn’t know where to go.
                Taking the burden off of someone by helping them find resources to help them, I feel is a great way to lessen what they’re going through.
                Bringing them solutions and watching the fear/stress/anxiety wash away if even for a brief moment, is what drives me.

            <p><b>Being a voice of reason in uncertainty - </b>
                I think that the best advice you can give to someone is honesty
                No one benefits from false truths, telling them what they want to hear sets them up for a bigger fall.
                Being kind, vulnerable, open, and honest. Is to me, the best way to get through to someone.

                <b>Advocating for those who are lost - </b>
                Advocating for the lost lifts me up, we have all been there and would not be where we are without our lighthouses.
                Encouraging someone to see their perceived shortcomings and weaknesses as strengths and opportunities is a mindset shift we all need at times.
                Counseling by example, I love sharing my story specifically the painful broken parts and ways that I was able to move through them and how, looking back, I wouldn’t trade my scars for the world. 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Being a silent support- </b>
                I wish more people knew the value of silence to someone in pain.
                Our most powerful organ in human connection is our ears.
                Listening without judgment, without waiting for your turn to speak, and without pre-generated words of condolence is one of the greatest gifts you can give someone who is lost and in pain.

                Finding solutions, creating how to’s/training material, and hosting training calls is my favorite part of being a leader for me.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>1:1’s - </b>
                When the training is a more sensitive matter, connecting with someone 1:1 and talking through the issue, what we can do next time, and answering questions is a great way to assist people on a personal level. Getting on their level and breaking down the issue and rebuilding it into a solution is fun watching people get that breakthrough.

            <p><b>Hosting info share sessions - </b>
                I am a very open person personally and professionally (with boundaries of course), but one of my favorite things to do is connect with those around me and when I sense a common struggle, I love getting everyone together with an expert and sharing everything we’ve learned, gotten stuck on, etc and learning from each other. Growing that micro-community in knowledge.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Meeting new people and learning about their community - </b>
                One thing I do when traveling is I love to “get lost”, I get in the car and drive until I see an area to explore. Like ethnic enclaves in big cities and see what their food is like, how are they interacting, and what type of music is playing. As Anthony Bourdain lived, open mouth, open mind, open heart.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Listening to my adversaries to gain insight into my opportunities - </b>
                I believe if we let them, our adversaries can teach us a lot about ourselves. What is our opportunity in this interaction, and how could we have done better?
                Again listening to people, even angry ones, can teach us a lot about what they need.
                They may not be great about voicing what's wrong, but we can meet them in listening and humility. Most of the time, people just want to be heard.
